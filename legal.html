    <!-- ====== PRIVACY POLICY ====== -->
    <h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>TallyAero ("AeroEdge," "we," "us," or "our") operates the TallyAero website (tallyaero.com) and the AeroEdge Logbook web application (aeroedge-logbook.web.app). This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>

    <p><strong>Logbook Data:</strong> Flight entries, pilot profile, certificates, aircraft information, and documents you upload.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Basic analytics (via Google Analytics) to understand how the site and app are used.</p>

    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the logbook application</li>
      <li>To send notification emails if you opt in (e.g., currency expiration reminders, medical certificate alerts, document expiration warnings)</li>
      <li>To send SMS text messages if you opt in (e.g., FAA currency alerts, medical certificate reminders, aircraft maintenance notifications)</li>
      <li>To respond to your support inquiries</li>
      <li>To improve our products</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Storage &amp; Security</h3>
    <p>Your data is stored using Firebase (Google Cloud). Data is encrypted in transit using TLS and at rest using AES-256 encryption. Sensitive documents are encrypted at rest. Your authentication tokens, draft entries, and local cache remain on your device only.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>We use the following third-party services solely for app functionality:</p>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>We never sell your data.</strong> These services are used solely for app functionality.</p>

    <h3>Data Ownership &amp; Export</h3>
    <p>Your data is yours. The app supports local-first storage and full data export. You can use the application entirely offline without syncing to the cloud. If you choose to delete your account, all cloud-stored data will be removed.</p>
