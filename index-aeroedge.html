        <div class="dashtwo-ai-msg">
          <h4 class="dashtwo-ai-heading dashtwo-ai-heading-red">You Cannot Legally Fly at Night Right Now &mdash; Multiple Regulatory Barriers</h4>
          <p>Based on your logbook data and the regulations, you have three separate compliance problems that must be resolved before you can take a friend flying at night:</p>

          <h4 class="dashtwo-ai-subheading">PROBLEM 1: Flight Review Expired</h4>
          <p><strong>Status: Your flight review has expired.</strong> Per <strong>14 CFR 61.56(c)</strong>, you may not act as pilot in command of any aircraft unless you have completed a flight review within the preceding 24 calendar months. At 14 months of inactivity, you are well past that deadline.</p>
          <p><strong>What you must do:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Schedule and complete a 1-hour flight + 1-hour ground review with an authorized instructor</li>
            <li>The instructor must endorse your logbook certifying satisfactory completion</li>
            <li>This is a prerequisite to any other flying</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="dashtwo-ai-subheading">PROBLEM 2: Day Passenger Currency Expired</h4>
          <p><strong>Status: NOT CURRENT for day VFR with passengers.</strong> Your logbook shows 12 day landings in the last 90 days, with the last landing 9 days ago. However, those landings are now outside the 90-day window due to your 14-month gap. Per <strong>14 CFR 61.57(a)(1)</strong>, you must have made at least 3 takeoffs and 3 landings within the preceding 90 days to carry passengers during day VFR.</p>
          <p><strong>What you must do:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete at least 3 takeoffs and 3 landings as sole manipulator of the flight controls in the same aircraft category/class</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="dashtwo-ai-subheading">PROBLEM 3: Night Passenger Currency &mdash; NOT CURRENT</h4>
          <p><strong>Status: You cannot legally fly at night with passengers.</strong> Per <strong>14 CFR 61.57(b)(1)</strong>, to act as pilot in command carrying passengers during the period 1 hour after sunset to 1 hour before sunrise, you must have made at least 3 takeoffs and 3 landings to a full stop during that same night period within the preceding 90 days. Your logbook shows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>72.8 hours of night time total</li>
            <li>12 night landings in the last 90 days</li>
            <li>But zero full-stop night landings (your recent night landings were touch-and-goes during carrier qualification training)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Critical distinction:</strong> Touch-and-go landings do NOT satisfy 61.57(b). The regulation explicitly requires "landings to a full stop."</p>

          <h4 class="dashtwo-ai-subheading">Your Regulatory Pathway</h4>
          <p>To legally take your friend flying at night, execute this sequence:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Schedule a flight review with a CFI</strong> (1 hour flight + 1 hour ground) &mdash; This unlocks your ability to act as PIC at all</li>
            <li><strong>Perform 3 day takeoffs and 3 day landings</strong> with an instructor &mdash; Regains day passenger currency per 61.57(a)</li>
            <li><strong>Perform 3 night full-stop landings</strong> with an instructor &mdash; Regains night passenger currency per 61.57(b). These must occur during the period 1 hour after sunset to 1 hour before sunrise. Each landing must be a full stop (not a touch-and-go).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Once all three are complete, you can legally carry your friend on a night flight.</p>

          <h4 class="dashtwo-ai-subheading">Important Note on Your Military Experience</h4>
          <p>Your logbook shows extensive carrier qualification and night vision goggle training in military turbine aircraft (F/A-18E/F, T-45C, T-6B). However, <strong>14 CFR 61.57 applies to all pilots</strong>, regardless of military background. The regulation does not grandfather military night currency into civilian operations. You must meet the civilian standard: 3 full-stop night landings in the preceding 90 days in a civilian aircraft category/class.</p>

          <h4 class="dashtwo-ai-heading">Loss of Control in Flight Training: What NTSB Data Shows and How to Teach Stall Recognition/Recovery</h4>

          <h4 class="dashtwo-ai-subheading">What NTSB Accident Data Reveals</h4>
          <p><strong>The Scope of the Problem</strong> &mdash; Per FAA Advisory Circular 61-67C and multiple safety alerts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stall/spin accidents account for approximately <strong>one-quarter of all fatal general aviation accidents</strong></li>
            <li>Loss of Control In-flight (LOC-I) is the <strong>#1 cause of GA fatalities</strong> &mdash; approximately 50% of all aviation fatalities</li>
            <li>Most stall/spin accidents occur when a pilot is momentarily distracted from the primary task of flying</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Common Scenarios (from NTSB reports):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Base-to-final turn</strong> &mdash; Overshooting centerline, excessive bank, accelerated stall</li>
            <li><strong>Engine failure on takeoff</strong> &mdash; Attempting to return to runway at low altitude</li>
            <li><strong>Low-altitude maneuvering</strong> &mdash; Low passes, steep pull-ups, aggressive maneuvering</li>
            <li><strong>Distraction-induced stalls</strong> &mdash; Fixating on ground objects, dealing with emergencies</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="dashtwo-ai-subheading">What the FAA Wants CFIs to Emphasize</h4>

          <p><strong>1. Angle of Attack &mdash; Not Airspeed &mdash; Causes Stalls</strong></p>
          <p>From <strong>AC 61-67C</strong>: "A stall is a loss of lift and increase in drag that occurs when an aircraft is flown at an angle of attack greater than the angle for maximum lift... <strong>A STALL CAN OCCUR AT ANY AIRSPEED, IN ANY ATTITUDE, AT ANY POWER SETTING.</strong>"</p>

          <p><strong>2. The Stall Recovery Template (from AC 120-109A)</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Reduce AOA (push forward) &mdash; <strong>THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL ACTION</strong></li>
            <li>Apply maximum thrust (unless contraindicated)</li>
            <li>Roll wings level (coordinated aileron and rudder)</li>
            <li>Return to desired flight path (avoid secondary stall)</li>
          </ol>

          <p><strong>3. Current ACS Standards (SAFO 17009)</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Slow Flight:</strong> Establish airspeed where any further AOA increase, load factor increase, or power reduction would result in stall warning. Do NOT fly with continuous stall warning.</li>
            <li><strong>Power-Off &amp; Power-On Stalls:</strong> Acknowledge cues of impending stall, then recover promptly after full stall. Smooth, coordinated inputs throughout.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>4. Recognize the "Mush"</strong></p>
          <p>If the elevator is at or near full aft deflection and the airplane is descending, it is stalled &mdash; reduce AOA immediately. The vertical speed indicator may show 800+ fpm descent while the pilot holds full back pressure without a traditional stall break.</p>

          <p><strong>5. Avoid Secondary Stalls</strong></p>
          <p>From <strong>AC 120-109A</strong>: After reducing AOA and adding power, do not aggressively pull back. Allow airspeed to build. <strong>SAFO 17009 explicitly states:</strong> "Evaluation criteria for a recovery from an impending stall should not include a predetermined value for altitude loss."</p>

          <h4 class="dashtwo-ai-subheading">How to Teach Stall Recognition and Recovery</h4>

          <p><strong>Phase 1: Maneuver-Based Training (altitude)</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Slow Flight at airspeed where any increase in AOA triggers warning</li>
            <li>Power-on, power-off, and accelerated stalls in various configurations</li>
            <li>Recovery using the stall recovery template</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Phase 2: Scenario-Based Training (realistic distractions)</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simulated radio calls during pattern work</li>
            <li>Simulated passenger questions and emergencies</li>
            <li>Overshooting base-to-final (teach go-around, not "salvaging")</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Phase 3: Upset Recovery Training</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unusual attitudes and upset recovery</li>
            <li>Emphasis: Reduce AOA first, then recover from unusual attitude</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="dashtwo-ai-subheading">What NOT to Teach</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>"Minimize altitude loss"</strong> &mdash; Encourages secondary stalls. ACS removed altitude loss criteria.</li>
            <li><strong>"Stalls only happen at low airspeed"</strong> &mdash; False. Accelerated stalls occur at cruise speed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>30+ years of operational experience and academic research</strong>, translated
            into tools that actually work. Fighter-grade engineering meets evidence-based learning design.

            This isn't a VC-funded startup. It's tools built to solve real problems &mdash;
            the problems we've experienced personally, transitioning from military to civilian
            aviation, teaching students, and wanting better than what exists.
